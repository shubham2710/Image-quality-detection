# Image-quality-detection
built a classifier which will predict whether a given image is blurred.

# Convolutional Neural Network
* A Convolutional Neural Network is trained which yields an accuracy of 79% on the evaluation dataset. The deep learning model has five layers. This accuracy can further be improved by increasing the input dimensions of the first layer in the model and the number of epochs.

* sample images is attached on which I have tested my model.
